Add movies to CouchPotato from Launch Center Pro on iOS, using Pythonista

To set this up, you need to do the following:

*	Add [this action](http://launchcenterpro.com/lf28l9) to Launch Center Pro.
*	Add the couchpotato.py file from this repository to Pythonista. There are plenty of ways to do this. A simple way would be to just copy the source of the file directly from [this repository page](https://github.com/nielskreijveld/lcp-pythonista-couchpotato/blob/master/couchpotato.py), create a new empty file in Pythonista named couchpotato.py, and paste in the code.
*	Open the couchpotato.py file in Pythonista and add the URL of your CouchPotato installation, as well as your API key, which can be found in Couchpotato's web interface under Settings -> General -> Show Advanced Settings.
*	Fire up the Launch Center Pro action to see if it works.
