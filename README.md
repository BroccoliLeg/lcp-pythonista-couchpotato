Add movies to CouchPotato from Launch Center Pro on iOS, using Pythonista

To set this up, you need to do the following:

1) Add a Launch Center Pro action that prompts for a search: http://launchcenterpro.com/lf28l9
2) Add the couchpotato.py file to Pythonista. There are plenty of ways to do this. A simple way would be to just copy the source of the file directly from the repository page and paste it in a new Pythonista file named couchpotato.py: https://github.com/nielskreijveld/lcp-pythonista-couchpotato/blob/master/couchpotato.py
3) Open the couchpotato.py file in Pythonista and add the URL of your CouchPotato installation, as well as the API key, which can be found under Settings -> General -> Show Advanced Settings.
4) Fire up the Launch Center Pro action to see if it works.
